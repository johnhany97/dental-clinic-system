# Dental Clinic System

## Description
This project is built to reflect what a dental clinic's appointments and patients management system would be like.

## Scenario
The clinic has two doctors, a Dentist & a hygienist. Both have their seperate calendars. The clinic also has a secretary responsible for managing the appointments and the patients.

## Features
- Login system
- Special Doctor view optimised for usability given that it is to be used on a touch screen for the soul purpose of checking a given day's appointments and adding notes and treatments for an appointment
- Secretary view designed to make everything easily and quickly reached
- Supports patients having health plans
- Payments simulation system
- Different appointment types
- Setup Wizard that runs on the first run of the app or when an error is found with the database tables
- Week-view for appointments in the secretary view
- Day-view for appointments in the Doctor view

## To run
You need to be connected to the University of Sheffield's network to be able to access the database currently being used with this app.
Assuming that's the case, simply run the file called Application.java

## Additional notes
You could add the argument "dev" to the application when running it. This wilil re setup the database with dummy data.
